# Airbnb-Project

Overview and Data

This project involves data collected from Airbnb. The data was collected by Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com) and made available under a Creative Commons license.

The purpose of the project is to provide an opportunity to work with “messy” data to answer “ill defined” questions. In other words, there is a lot of data here—some of
which you won’t use and some of it you will probably need to process/clean to use effectively. And, I’ll ask some questions for which there is no “correct” answer. 
Or, at least, we aren’t able to know the correct answer with certainty.

I downloaded all available data on Denver’s Airbnb market on April 27th , 2019. I’ve uploaded three of these .csv files to Canvas:

1) denver_calendar.csv

2) denver_listings.csv

3) dever_reviews.csv
CSVs link can be get here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nePm-QUf2SLguGilAGNe0E9TM_2mN-z7?usp=sharing

There does not seem to be documentation for all the variable fields (although maybe you can find it!), but most are pretty self-explanatory.
